main method:
  create scanner object
  loop until user tells program to stop
  get user input
  pass input into method produceAnswer and print return

  separate the operands into different substrings
  make mixed fractions into improper fractions
  if operator is multiplication then multiply fractions
  if operator is division then multiply using reciprocal of second operand
  if operator is addition then use LCM to get common denominators and match the numerators to change in denominator then add numerators
  if operator is subtraction then use LCM to get common denominators and match the numerators to change in denominator then subtract numerators
